- [✅] Drift & Polymarket connectors 
- [] arb strat (in progress)
- [] test script
- [] cross exchange MM

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn
- Ethereum wallet with some MATIC for gas fees
- Solana wallet with some SOL for gas fees
- USDC balance on both Polygon and Solana networks

## Repository Structure

- `src/connectors/`: Contains BaseConnector, PolymarketConnector and DriftConnector
- `src/strategies/`: Includes BaseStrategy, ArbStrategy for arbitrage logic
- `config/`: Contains prod.ts which you can modify
- `src/utils/`: Utilities like ConfigService and Logger
- `src/index.ts`: Main execution file

## Getting started

1. Copy the .env.example and create a new .env file at the root of the project

2. Fill in the required environment variables in the .env file. Your environment variables never leave your device. Double check the source code to ensure this is the case! (Don't trust, verify!)

3. Ensure you have sufficient USDC balance on both Polygon and Solana networks for Polymarket and Drift. 
 
4. Install dependencies:
   - run npm install to install the required dependencies

5. Adjusting the strategy:
- Open `config/prod.ts`
- Modify the `params` object in the strategy configuration:
  - `market_id`: Set the market ID for the market you want to trade. It is the slug of the market you want to trade. You can get the slug from the URL of Polymarket/Drift 

  - `polymarket market_id example`
  In the case of PolyMarket, https://polymarket.com/event/will-biden-announce-resignation-by-august-31?tid=1725034578450

  Slug would be will-biden-announce-resignation-by-august-31

  - `drift market_id example`
    In the case of Drift, let's say the URL is https://app.drift.trade/bet/TRUMP-WIN-2024-BET , 
    the slug would be TRUMP-WIN-2024-BET

  - `balance_perc`: Adjust the percentage of your balance to use for trades
  
  - `min_spread`: Set the minimum price difference required for the bot to execute a trade
- Save the config file

7. Monitor the bot's activity:

   - The bot will log important events, including initialization status, balance updates, and trade executions.
